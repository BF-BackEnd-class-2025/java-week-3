# Week 3: Advanced OOP â€“ Inheritance, Polymorphism & Interfaces

This week focuses on deepening understanding of OOP concepts, setting the foundation for more advanced topics next week.

## Topics Covered

* **Inheritance**

    * Extending classes (`extends`)
    * Overriding methods
    * Upcasting and downcasting
    * `super` keyword usage

* **Polymorphism**

    * Dynamic method dispatch
    * Polymorphic references

* **Abstract Classes & Interfaces**

    * Abstract classes vs interfaces
    * Implementing interfaces
    * Multiple interface implementation
    * Interface default and static methods

* **Encapsulation & Access Modifiers**

    * `private`, `protected`, `public`, default
    * Getters and setters
    * Immutable classes

## Activities

* Create class hierarchies demonstrating inheritance and polymorphism
* Implement multiple interfaces in a single class
* Practice encapsulation with proper access modifiers and getters/setters
