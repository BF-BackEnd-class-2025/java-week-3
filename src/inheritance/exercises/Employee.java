 TODO:
 1. Create a superclass Employee with:
      - name (String), salary (double).
      - method work() → prints "<name> is working".
 2. Create subclasses Developer and Manager:
      - Developer overrides work() → prints "<name> is writing code".
      - Manager overrides work() → prints "<name> is managing the team".
 3. Test both in a main class.
